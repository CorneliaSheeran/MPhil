# MPhil

## Epochs
- All graphical variables plotted over the training epochs (spiking and rate-based)

## Fractal 
- Code to find the Shannon Entropy of fixed modularity and fractal graphs

## FUNCTIONS_scripts
- All the Matlab functions (Shannon entropy, Topological entropy etc.) required to run plotting scripts

## Geo-Mod
- Graphical variables plotted against geometric modularity (OR curvature) (spiking and rate-based)

## Misc
- Miscallenous code (includes a robustness measure etc.)

## Modularity
- Graphical variables plotted against classical modularity (Q-statistic) (spiking and rate-based)

## PID
- Partial-Information Decomposition plotting scripts

## Modularity
- Graphical variables plotted against the smallworld measure (spiking and rate-based)
